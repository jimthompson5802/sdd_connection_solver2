# Feature Specification: NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant Web Application

**Feature Branch**: `001-nyt-connections-puzzle`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant Web Application - Develop a web application that assists users in solving the New York Times Connections Puzzle. The application will leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate recommendations for grouping words and tracks invalid guesses to enhance the solving experience. For this first phase we will focus only the web UI and user interactions."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A puzzle enthusiast visits the web application to get assistance solving a New York Times Connections puzzle. They upload their puzzle file containing 16 words, receive AI-powered recommendations for grouping four words together, and track their progress as they work through the puzzle by recording correct groups and mistakes until they either solve all four groups or reach the maximum number of allowed errors.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is loaded, **When** the user uploads a puzzle file and clicks "Setup Puzzle", **Then** the system displays all 16 words in the "Remaining Puzzle Words" area and resets all counters to zero
2. **Given** a puzzle is set up, **When** the user clicks "Next Recommendation", **Then** the system displays a group of 4 words with a connection rationale
3. **Given** a recommendation is displayed, **When** the user clicks a color button (Yellow/Green/Blue/Purple), **Then** that button becomes disabled and gray, the recommended words are removed from remaining words, and the correct groups counter increments
4. **Given** a recommendation is displayed, **When** the user clicks "Incorrect", **Then** the mistake counter increments and the group is added to previous guesses in red
5. **Given** a recommendation is displayed, **When** the user clicks "One-away", **Then** the mistake counter increments, the group is added to "Incorrect Groups" list with "one-away" indicator and rationale, and the group appears in previous guesses with orange color coding
6. **Given** the user has 4 correct groups, **When** the count reaches 4, **Then** a success popup displays "Successfully solved the Puzzle"
7. **Given** the user has 4 mistakes, **When** the mistake count reaches 4, **Then** a failure popup displays "Unable to Solve puzzle" and all buttons except "Setup Puzzle" are disabled

### Edge Cases
- System displays error message and prevents setup when puzzle file is empty or invalid CSV format
- System displays error message "Not enough words remaining" when fewer than 4 words available for recommendation
- System displays error message "No recommendation to respond to" when response buttons clicked without active recommendation

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: What file format should the puzzle file use for uploading the 16 words? → A: CSV file with all words in a single row
- Q: What should happen when the user clicks "Next Recommendation" but there are fewer than 4 remaining words? → A: Display error message "Not enough words remaining"
- Q: What should happen when the user uploads an invalid or empty CSV file? → A: Display error message and prevent setup
- Q: What should happen if the user clicks response buttons when no recommendation is currently displayed? → A: Display error message "No recommendation to respond to"
- Q: What performance target should the system meet for generating recommendations when "Next Recommendation" is clicked? → A: No specific time requirement

## Requirements
