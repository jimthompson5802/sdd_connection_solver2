# Research: LLM Provider Integration

## Overview
This document captures research findings for integrating multiple LLM providers (ollama, openai) into the connection puzzle solver, enabling AI-powered word recommendations while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Technology Integration Decisions

### LLM Framework Selection
**Decision**: Use langchain for LLM provider abstraction  
**Rationale**: 
- Provides unified interface for multiple LLM providers (ollama, openai)
- Handles authentication, request formatting, and response parsing
- Well-established library with good TypeScript/Python support
- Abstracts provider-specific implementation details
- Supports both local (ollama) and cloud (openai) providers

**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct API integration: Rejected due to complexity of managing multiple provider APIs
- OpenAI SDK only: Rejected due to requirement for ollama support
- Custom abstraction layer: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

### Environment Configuration Pattern
**Decision**: Use python-dotenv for .env file management  
**Rationale**:
- Simple configuration without external dependencies
- Supports local development workflow
- Secure credential management (not in version control)
- Standard pattern for Python applications
- Easy to document and maintain

**Alternatives considered**:
- OS environment variables only: Rejected due to development convenience
- Configuration files: Rejected due to credential security concerns
- Command-line arguments: Rejected due to poor user experience

### Prompt Engineering Strategy
**Decision**: Template-based prompts with structured context injection  
**Rationale**:
- Ensures consistent prompt format across providers
- Easy to test and modify prompt templates
- Structured injection of puzzle state prevents prompt injection
- Clear separation of static template and dynamic content
- Supports A/B testing of prompt variations

**Alternatives considered**:
- Dynamic prompt generation: Rejected due to unpredictability
- Provider-specific prompts: Rejected due to maintenance complexity
- User-customizable prompts: Rejected due to scope complexity

### Error Handling Approach
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages  
**Rationale**:
- Maintains application availability when LLM providers fail
- Clear communication of issues to users
- No automatic retry to avoid confusion (per clarifications)
- Preserves simple algorithm as reliable fallback
- Prevents cascading failures

**Alternatives considered**:
- Automatic retry mechanisms: Rejected based on clarification session
- Silent fallback to simple algorithm: Rejected due to user transparency needs
- Detailed technical error messages: Rejected due to user experience concerns

## Implementation Patterns

### Provider Factory Pattern
**Decision**: Factory pattern for LLM provider instantiation  
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation of provider configuration logic
- Easy to add new providers in future
- Centralized credential management
- Testable through dependency injection
- Follows SOLID principles

### Response Validation Strategy
**Decision**: Pydantic models for response validation  
**Rationale**:
- Type-safe response parsing
- Consistent error handling for invalid responses
- Integration with FastAPI ecosystem
- Clear documentation of expected response format
- Runtime validation with helpful error messages

### Frontend State Management
**Decision**: React component state for LLM provider selection  
**Rationale**:
- Simple session-only persistence (per clarifications)
- No external state management library needed
- Consistent with existing Phase 1 patterns
- Easy to test and reason about
- Minimal complexity for single-form input

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management
- API keys stored in .env file (development)
- Environment variables accessed only on backend
- No credentials exposed to frontend
- Clear documentation for production deployment

### Input Validation
- Strict validation of provider:model format
- Sanitization of puzzle words before LLM prompts
- Validation of LLM responses against remaining words
- Protection against prompt injection attacks

### Error Information Disclosure
- Generic error messages to users
- Detailed errors logged on backend only
- No sensitive information in frontend error states
- Clear distinction between user errors and system errors

## Testing Strategy

### Mock Strategy for LLM Providers
- Mock langchain provider responses for unit tests
- Predefined response sets for consistent testing
- Error simulation for failure scenario testing
- Performance testing with simulated latency

### Contract Testing
- OpenAPI schema validation for new endpoints
- Response format validation
- Error response format consistency
- Integration test coverage for provider switching

## Performance Considerations

### Response Time Management
- No timeout requirements (per clarifications)
- Loading indicator implementation
- Non-blocking UI during LLM requests
- Graceful handling of slow responses

### Resource Usage
- Memory-efficient prompt generation
- Minimal state storage (session-only)
- Efficient validation of LLM responses
- No caching required (session-based operation)

## Integration Points

### Backend Extensions
- New LLM service layer
- Provider factory implementation
- Enhanced recommendation endpoint
- Configuration management service

### Frontend Modifications
- LLM provider input field
- Enhanced loading states
- Error message display
- Provider selection persistence (session-only)

### API Contract Changes
- Extended recommendation request format
- New error response types
- Provider validation endpoints
- Enhanced response metadata

## Deployment Considerations

### Local Development
- .env file template documentation
- Local ollama setup instructions
- OpenAI API key configuration
- Development environment validation

### Configuration Management
- Environment variable documentation
- Provider availability testing
- Graceful handling of missing providers
- Clear setup error messages
