jimthompson5802: run frontend test

GitHub Copilot: I'll open the frontend's package.json to see the test script, then run the frontend tests once (non-interactive) and report results. I'll first read the package.json, then run the test command in the frontend directory. Expected outcome: test run output and pass/fail summary.

I'll run the frontend tests once (non-interactive) by setting CI=true and passing --watchAll=false, so tests execute and exit with results. I'll run the command in the frontend directory and return the test output. 

Ran terminal command: cd /Users/jim/Desktop/genai/sdd_connection_solver2/frontend && CI=true npm test --silent -- --watchAll=false

I ran the frontend test suite and captured the results. Below is a concise summary, failing-test details, how to reproduce locally, and recommended next steps.

## Actions taken
- Read package.json to find the test script.
- Ran the frontend tests once (non-interactive) from the frontend folder:
  - Command used: CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false

## Result summary
- Test suites: 5 total — 4 passed, 1 failed
- Tests: 38 total — 31 passed, 7 failed
- Time: ~5.1s
- Exit status: failed (non-zero exit code)

## Failing suite and failure causes
- Failing test file: App.test.tsx
- Failure summary (key points):
  - Several tests expect the app title "NYT Connection Solver Virtual Assistant" but the rendered heading is "NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant". This causes getByText/getByRole assertions to fail.
  - Tests also expect elements with data-testid values like `app-container` and `puzzle-interface`, but those data-testid attributes aren't present in the rendered DOM, causing getByTestId to fail.
- Concrete failing assertions (examples from output):
  - Unable to find element with text: /NYT Connection Solver Virtual Assistant/i — actual text: "NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant"
  - Unable to find element by: [data-testid="app-container"]
  - Unable to find element by: [data-testid="puzzle-interface"]

These indicate either the component UI changed (title text / structure) or the tests were written expecting attributes that were removed/renamed.

## How you can reproduce locally
Run this in your project root (same as I ran):

```bash
cd /Users/jim/Desktop/genai/sdd_connection_solver2/frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false
```

To re-run only the failing test file:

```bash
cd /Users/jim/Desktop/genai/sdd_connection_solver2/frontend
CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false src/components/App.test.tsx
```

Or run interactive watch mode (useful during fixes):

```bash
cd /Users/jim/Desktop/genai/sdd_connection_solver2/frontend
npm test
```

## Suggested next steps
Pick one of these depending on intended behaviour:

1. Update tests to match current UI
   - Change the expected heading text in `src/components/App.test.tsx` from "NYT Connection Solver Virtual Assistant" to "NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant" (or a more flexible matcher).
   - Add or update queries to match current DOM (e.g., use roles, accessible labels, or adjust data-testid expectations).
   - Re-run tests.

2. Update the component to match the test contract
   - If the tests reflect the desired UI, update `src/App.tsx` (or the relevant component) to include:
     - the exact heading text expected by tests
     - `data-testid="app-container"` and `data-testid="puzzle-interface"` where appropriate
   - Re-run tests.

3. I can fix tests or component for you
   - If you want, I can:
     - Edit `src/components/App.test.tsx` to align expectations with the current app text and DOM, then re-run tests and push changes to the branch.
     - Or modify the component to restore the expected test contract.
   - Tell me which approach you prefer and I’ll implement it and re-run the tests.

## Requirements coverage
- User request: "run frontend test" — Done (tests executed and results reported).
- Next-step options: Provided (update tests, update component, or I can implement a fix).

Would you like me to update the tests to match the current UI, or modify the component to match the tests? I can make the change and re-run the test suite.

jimthompson5802: update test to reflect current UI

GitHub Copilot: I'll open the failing test file App.test.tsx to update its expectations to match the current UI (title & testids), then run the frontend tests. I'll first read the test file. 

Read [](file:///Users/jim/Desktop/genai/sdd_connection_solver2/frontend/src/components/App.test.tsx)

I'll update App.test.tsx to match the current UI (title text, remove data-testid checks, use accessible queries like role/label), then run the frontend tests once to verify. Expected outcome: tests that previously failed will now align with the current DOM and the suite will pass (or show remaining failures). 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I'll re-run the frontend tests once (non-interactive) to verify the updated tests pass. 

Ran terminal command: CI=true npm test --silent -- --watchAll=false

Progress update — I updated the failing tests to match the current UI and re-ran the frontend test suite.

What I changed
- Edited App.test.tsx:
  - Updated expected heading text to "NYT Connections Puzzle Assistant".
  - Replaced brittle `getByTestId` checks with accessible queries (role, label, button name) and class-based DOM checks that match the current markup.
  - Verified the setup button is present and initially disabled.

What I ran
- Command: CI=true npm test -- --watchAll=false (executed in frontend)

Results
- All tests now pass.
  - Test suites: 5 passed
  - Tests: 38 passed
  - Time: ~2.2s

Files changed
- App.test.tsx — updated assertions to reflect actual DOM and accessible queries.

Next steps (optional)
- If you'd rather keep the original contract (data-testids and old heading), I can modify the component (`src/App.tsx`) instead to restore them.
- If you'd like, I can open a small PR with the test change and a short commit message.
- I can also add a brief comment in the test explaining the decision to prefer accessible queries (recommended).

If you want me to proceed with any of the optional actions, tell me which and I'll implement it.

Made changes.
