I'll read key frontend and backend entry modules to map services and interactions (expected outcome: a concise list of components and their responsibilities, then a Mermaid architecture diagram). I'll fetch the main frontend files and the main backend modules in parallel.

I'll summarize what I inspected and then produce a single Mermaid architecture diagram showing the user -> web page -> frontend -> backend interactions (including the frontend service and backend services/endpoints).

## Quick progress update
I read the main frontend and backend entry modules to map responsibilities:
- Frontend: App.tsx, index.tsx, package.json
- Backend: main.py, api.py, recommendation_engine.py

What's next: below is a concise component summary followed by the Mermaid architecture diagram you can paste into a Mermaid renderer (or view in VS Code's Mermaid preview).

## Component summary (concise)
- User / Browser
  - Interacts with the web UI (React app) via the browser.

- Frontend (React)
  - App.tsx: orchestrates app flow and state (upload, request recommendation, record response).
  - `FileUpload` component (used by `App`): uploads CSV content containing words to start a puzzle.
  - `PuzzleInterface` component (used by `App`): displays words, request recommendation button, records user responses.
  - `services/api` (referenced as `apiService` in `App`): client layer that calls backend endpoints:
    - POST /api/puzzle/setup_puzzle
    - GET /api/puzzle/next_recommendation
    - POST /api/puzzle/record_response
  - Runs typically on React dev server (http://localhost:3000); calls backend at http://localhost:8000.

- Backend (FastAPI)
  - main.py: FastAPI app creation, CORS middleware (allows requests from dev server), and root/health endpoints.
  - api.py: API router implementing puzzle endpoints:
    - `/api/puzzle/setup_puzzle` (POST) — create a new session from uploaded words
    - `/api/puzzle/next_recommendation` (GET) — return recommended group of 4 words and connection
    - `/api/puzzle/record_response` (POST) — record user's response to last recommendation
  - recommendation_engine.py: `RecommendationEngine` — encapsulates heuristics to suggest word groupings; used by the API to generate recommendations.
  - `models` (referenced in api.py): session manager, `PuzzleSession`, DTOs and enums (in-memory session state is used by the API).

- Data / State
  - Sessions are held in an in-memory `session_manager` (used by endpoints). No external DB is shown in the files inspected.

- Cross-cutting
  - CORS is configured in main.py to allow the React app origin(s).
  - Dev UIs: FastAPI docs available at docs.

## Mermaid architecture diagram
Paste the following into a Mermaid renderer (mermaid.live, VS Code Mermaid preview, or any tool that supports Mermaid):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  %% User and browser
  User["User\n(Browser)"]

  %% Frontend subgraph
  subgraph Frontend [Frontend (React app)]
    BrowserPage["Web Page\n(React App)"]
    FileUpload["FileUpload\n(component)"]
    PuzzleInterface["PuzzleInterface\n(component)"]
    APIService["apiService\n(client)"]
  end

  %% Backend subgraph
  subgraph Backend [Backend (FastAPI)]
    FastAPIApp["FastAPI app\n(main.py)"]
    APIRouter["API Router\n(api.py)\n(endpoints)"]
    RecEngine["Recommendation Engine\n(recommendation_engine.py)"]
    SessionMgr["Session Manager\n(models - in-memory)"]
    Models["DTOs & PuzzleSession\n(models.py)"]
  end

  %% Network / infra
  BrowserPage --- FileUpload
  BrowserPage --- PuzzleInterface
  FileUpload -->|upload CSV (content)| APIService
  PuzzleInterface -->|request recommendation| APIService
  PuzzleInterface -->|record response| APIService

  APIService -->|POST /api/puzzle/setup_puzzle| APIRouter
  APIService -->|GET /api/puzzle/next_recommendation| APIRouter
  APIService -->|POST /api/puzzle/record_response| APIRouter

  APIRouter -->|create/read/update| SessionMgr
  APIRouter -->|ask for recommendations| RecEngine
  RecEngine -->|reads/writes| Models
  SessionMgr -->|stores/reads| Models

  %% Deployment notes
  note right of APIService
    React dev server (localhost:3000)
  end

  note right of FastAPIApp
    FastAPI server (localhost:8000)\nCORS enabled for frontend origins
  end

  %% User interaction flow
  User -->|interacts with page| BrowserPage
```

(If you prefer a more compact directional layout use `flowchart TD` instead of `flowchart LR` — the content is the same.)

## How to view the diagram
- Paste the Mermaid code above into https://mermaid.live or into VS Code with the "Markdown Preview Enhanced" / Mermaid preview.
- Or embed it in a markdown file and use a renderer that supports Mermaid.

## Requirements coverage
- Codebase review of frontend and backend modules: Done (listed files inspected).
- Generated Mermaid architecture diagram including:
  - User interacting with a web page: Done (User -> Browser).
  - Frontend services and components: Done (React app, FileUpload, PuzzleInterface, apiService).
  - Backend services: Done (FastAPI app, API router / endpoints, Recommendation Engine, Session Manager / Models).
  - Endpoints and direction of calls: Done (arrow labels for the three endpoints).

## Next steps (optional suggestions)
- If you want, I can:
  - Add a persisted store (simple SQLite) to the session manager and update model interactions.
  - Produce a more detailed sequence diagram showing request/response payload shapes for each endpoint.
  - Generate a README.md with the architecture and local run instructions (React dev server + FastAPI).
Tell me which next step you'd like and I’ll implement it.
