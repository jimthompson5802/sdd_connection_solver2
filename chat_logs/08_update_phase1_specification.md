I'm going to read the current spec file to find the "Acceptance Scenarios", "Functional Requirements", and "Key Entities" sections so I can update them to match the frontend/backend modules; I'll read the full spec.md content. Expected outcome: get file contents for targeted edits.

I'll read four backend source files to understand how recommendations and puzzle state are represented: api.py, recommendation_engine.py, models.py, and main.py. Expected outcome: extract functional behavior to align the spec.

I'll read the main frontend app file and a couple of UI components to extract UI behavior and states to align the spec. I'll open App.tsx, components list, and components likely files. Expected outcome: extract interaction flows and entities for spec updates.

Now I'll read frontend services and types to capture the data shapes and constraints (e.g., api service wrappers and puzzle types). I'll open api.ts and puzzle.ts.

I'll update spec.md to reflect the actual behavior found in the frontend and backend modules: stricter CSV validation, exact counts, game-state transitions, required color for correct responses, recommendation rationale/hints, previous responses history, and error conditions. I'll apply a patch replacing the Acceptance Scenarios, Functional Requirements, and Key Entities sections. Expected outcome: spec.md updated to match code behavior at a logical level. 

Using "Apply Patch"


```

```
I've updated the spec to reflect the actual, logical behavior implemented in the frontend and backend modules. Summary of what I changed and why next:

## What I changed
- Rewrote the Acceptance Scenarios to match actual flows implemented in the app:
  - File validation and strict 16-unique-word requirement.
  - Recommendation request/response lifecycle (correct/incorrect/one-away).
  - Game-state transitions (win on 4 correct, loss on 4 mistakes).
  - Error handling for invalid actions (not enough words, no active recommendation, invalid file).

- Rewrote Functional Requirements to align with code-level behaviors but keep them at a logical, non-technical level:
  - Explicit validation requirements (exactly 16, non-empty, unique words).
  - Recommendation semantics: exactly 4 words plus rationale/hint.
  - Response semantics: color required for correct responses; one-away counts as a mistake.
  - State persistence expectations for the prototype (in-memory).
  - History/attempt recording and UI expectations (disabled colors, counters, user-facing error messages).

- Expanded Key Entities to better reflect the domain model used by the code:
  - Puzzle Session / Puzzle State, Word Group, Recommendation, User Attempt / Previous Response, Connection Color, and Validation/Error types.

Files edited:
- spec.md â€” updated Acceptance Scenarios, Functional Requirements, and Key Entities.

## Progress update & next steps
- I read the key backend files: api.py, models.py, recommendation_engine.py, and main.py.
- I read the main frontend files: App.tsx, PuzzleInterface.tsx, FileUpload.tsx, plus api.ts and puzzle.ts.
- Based on code behavior, I updated the spec (logical level only; no technical API or implementation details were added).

If you'd like, I can:
- Run a quick checklist to ensure every updated requirement maps to a specific module/behavior (traceability table).
- Add a short "Test Cases" subsection with concise manual test steps for QA based on the updated scenarios.
- Draft a brief release note summarizing the behavior for stakeholders.

Tell me which of the above you'd like next (or anything else), and I'll proceed.

Made changes.
