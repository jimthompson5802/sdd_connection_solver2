# Style Guide — docs-and-chatlogs

Unique conventions:

- Project contains narrative design notes and chat logs under `chat_logs/` documenting phase-by-phase decisions.
- Architecture and on-boarding notes live under `docs/`.
- Keep these artifacts current when making changes to architecture or LLM integration behaviors.

File examples: `docs/architecture.md`, `chat_logs/13_phase2_remove_traditional_webui_section.md`.
