# 1 — Determine Tech Stack

## Core Technology Analysis

- **Programming languages:**
  - Python (backend, requires >=3.11)
  - TypeScript/JavaScript (frontend via Create React App)

- **Primary frameworks / runtimes:**
  - Backend: `FastAPI` (async web API), served by `uvicorn`.
  - Frontend: React (Create React App) with `react-scripts`.

- **Key libraries & tools:**
  - Python: `pydantic` (data models/validation), `langchain` + `langchain-community` (LLM orchestration), `openai`, `langchain-openai`, `langchain-ollama` (LLM providers), `python-dotenv` for env loading.
  - Frontend: `react`, `react-dom`, `typescript`, testing libs (`@testing-library/*`).
  - Dev tooling: `black`, `mypy`, `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, `prettier`, `eslint`.

- **Testing & CI:**
  - Backend tests use `pytest` with `pytest-asyncio`, coverage config included in `pyproject.toml`.
  - Frontend uses React Testing Library and jest-related tooling.

- **Build/packaging:**
  - Backend: `hatchling` build backend (pyproject.toml).
  - Frontend: Create React App scripts (`react-scripts build`).

## State management & patterns

- No heavy-weight global state library (Redux/Zustand) is obvious from `package.json`; likely uses local React state or Context.
- Backend uses typical FastAPI dependency injection and pydantic models for DTOs.

## Domain Specificity

- **Target domain:** A virtual assistant to help solve NYT "Connections" puzzles — a puzzle/word-grouping domain.
- **Core concepts:** Puzzles (sets of words), word grouping/categorization, recommendations / LLM-driven suggestions, puzzle sessions/state.
- **User interactions supported:** API-backed puzzle solving flows (backend), interactive UI in React (frontend) for exploring suggestions, marking words, getting recommendations.
- **Primary data types:** Word lists (CSV in `/data`), puzzle records (CSV), DTOs for recommendations and LLM payloads.

## Application Boundaries (inferred)

- In-scope:
  - LLM-backed recommendation generation for puzzle solving
  - API endpoints to drive frontend UI and to run recommendation workflows
  - Frontend UI to present puzzles and accept user input
  - Tests and coverage for backend logic and LLM provider integrations

- Out-of-scope (architecturally inconsistent based on current code):
  - Heavy synchronous monolith or blocking server patterns (project uses async FastAPI/uvicorn)
  - Introducing a separate backend persistence layer (no DB configs evident; data seems file-based CSVs)
  - Replacing LLM orchestration with a single-vendor-only approach — current code supports multiple providers (OpenAI, Ollama, simple provider)

## Notes & Observations

- Multiple LLM provider adapters are present; the backend is designed to be LLM-agnostic via provider factory patterns.
- Strict typing and quality tooling are enforced (`mypy`, `black`, wide pytest config), indicating a preference for maintainable, well-typed backend code.
- Frontend is a TypeScript CRA app with ESLint and Prettier configuration — standard React patterns.
